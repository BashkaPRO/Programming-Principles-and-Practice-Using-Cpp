<h4 id="why">Why</h4>
<p>I thought GitHub would be a good place to share my solutions for the try its, review questions, drills, and exercises for the afore mentioned book.</p>
<h4 id="usefull-tools">Usefull tools</h4>
<p>I'm currently using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio Community</a> to go through this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects for each section.</p>
<p>An alternative solution for a C++ compiler is a variant of <a href="https://nuwen.net/mingw.html">MinGW distribution</a> listed here.
This distribution supports the latest GNU GCC compiler also packaged with Boost and other neat libraries.
This distribution also comes with the lates GNU Make so can create custome command line compiles created via you favorite editor.</p>
<h4 id="deviations">Deviations</h4>
<p>If you're reading along you will notice I intentionally left out the header file mentioned in the book.  Instead created a section header file for each of the sections
because in book header has been implimented into most compilers now, plus wanted some experiance dealing with custom header files.
If want can get header file from books website <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming">www.stroustrup.com/Programming</a></p>
