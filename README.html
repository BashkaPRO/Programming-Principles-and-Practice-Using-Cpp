<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444058171&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Programming%3A+Principles+and+Practice+Using+C%2B%2B">Click here for the link to PPP on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>I thought GitHub was a good place to share my solutions for the try its, drills, and exercises for the afore mentioned book.</p>
<p>I'm currently using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015</a> to go through this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects for each section.  The sections or projects will contain Try Its, Drills and Exercises for that section.</p>
<p>If you don't like Visual Studio an alternative C++ compiler solution is a variant of the <a href="http://nuwen.net/mingw.html">MinGW distribution</a> listed here.
When I last checked the distribution it was x64-native and GCC 6.3.0, Boost 1.63.0, and other neat library's.  Can use with your favorite IDE or just a command line compiler.
Hey call me crazy but maybe use both.  It helped me find some errors.</p>
<p>If you're reading along you will notice I intentionally left out the header file mentioned in the book.  Instead created a section header file for each of the sections, just for fun.</p>
<p>I left out the review questions also but I may add them later.
If anyone would like to add them, branch them and send me your work.</p>
<p>I'm new at this so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
