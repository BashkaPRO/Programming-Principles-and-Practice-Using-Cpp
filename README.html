<li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio Community</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nuwen.net/mingw.html">MinGW varient distribution</a> that supports the latest GNU GCC compiler also is packaged with Boost and other neat libraries.
Also, the distribution comes with the latest GNU Make program so you can create custom command line compiles from C++ files created via your favorite editor.</li>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>I will be using Microsoft Visual Studio Community to go through this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and added projects under the PPP solution for each section.
In the solution Configuration Properties I selected build for the section I'm working on and deselect the others.
If the sections contain mutliple files with a main function I just select Exclude from Project for the files I'm not working on
in the solution explorer tab.  Can always go back and add files back by selecting Include in Project. In the Solution Explorer tab you
can select view all files to see all the included and excluded files.</p>
<h4 id="deviations">Deviations</h4>
<p>If you're reading along you will notice I intentionally left out the header file mentioned in the book.  Instead I created a section header file for each of the sections
because in the book's presented header file the functions have been implimented into most modern compilers, plus I wanted some experiance dealing with custom header files.
If you want, you can get the header file from book's website <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming">www.stroustrup.com/Programming</a></p>
