# Programming: Principles and Practices Using C++ (PPP)
[Click here for the link to PPP on Amazon.] (http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1444058171&sr=1-1&keywords=Programming%3A+Principles+and+Practice+Using+C%2B%2B)

I thought GitHub was a good place to share my solutions for the try its, drills, and exercises for the afore mentioned book.

I'm currently using [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015] (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) to go through this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects for each section.  The sections or projects will contain Try Its, Drills and Exercises for that section.

If you don't like Visual Studio a good solution for a GCC compiler is a variant of [MinGW distribution] (http://nuwen.net/mingw.html).
When I last checked the distribution it was x64-native and currently contains GCC 5.2.0 and Boost 1.59.0.

If you're reading along you will notice I intentionally left out the header file mentioned in the book.  Instead created a section header file for each of the sections, just for fun.

I left out the review questions also but I may add them later.
If anyone would like to add them, branch them and send me your work.  

I'm new at this so any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
