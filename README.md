# Programming: Principles and Pratices Using C++
A place to have solutions for the try its and drills

I'm using currently using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 to go thru this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects under this solution for the individual section Try Its and Drills.

I'm new at this so any comments are appriciated.
