# Programming: Principles and Pratices Using C++
My solutions for the try its, drills and exercises.

I'm currently using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 to go thru this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects for each section.  The sections or projects will contain Try Its, Drills and Exercises for that section.

If dont like Visual Studio an answer for a GCC compiler is a MinGW distribution http://nuwen.net/mingw.html
when last checked was the "distro" was x64-native and currently contains GCC 5.2.0 and Boost 1.59.0.

If reading along you will notice I intentialy left out the header file mentioned in the book.  Instead created a section header file for each section just for fun.

I left out the review questions also but may add later.
if anyone wants to add these branch and add them.  

I'm new at this so any suggestions is appriciated.
