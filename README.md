# Programming: Principles and Pratices Using C++
A place to have solutions for the try its, drills and exercises.

I'm currently using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 to go thru this book.
I created a solution folder named PPP and will be adding projects under this solution for the individual section Try Its, Drills and exercises.

If reading along will notice I intentialy left out the header file used in the book for the first few chapters
I left out the review questions also but may add later.

I'm new at this so any suggestions is appriciated.
